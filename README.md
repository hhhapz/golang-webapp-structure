# Indicators of Compromise
This is the first draft of an attempt at a reasonable project layout in Go, with interfaces at layer boundaries. I wanted an example project that wasn't the usual TODO application, so went with something a bit closer to home. This shows a list of indicators of compromise that are entered by the user, pretty simple.
